****** Break Statement:
When we try to break the code at a particular condition.
For example, I have a list of 1000 students and I want to find ID 5.
We set the condition that if we find id==5 then break. 
After executing this instruction code will not check for the ids that
come after 5 because there is no need to check the remaining id.

Break statement makes our code faster.

****** Continue Statement:
When we want to skip a particular condition.
For example, i am making an e-commerce website and i want to display 
the products that are in stock..and going to avoid the products that
are out of stock. Here, we set condition if products are "out of stock"
then continue searching for the next product that are avaiable in stock.

******* Pass Statement:
Whenever we are unsure about what to write inside of a loop but have idea
that we are going to need this loop, in this case we just create the loop
and pass it to next block so that code doesn't show error.
